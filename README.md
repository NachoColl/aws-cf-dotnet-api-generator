# Description

Cloudformation4dotNET is a tool you can use to automatically create the required cloudformation templates from your dotNET code. The idea is that you use it on your deployment pipelines, so you finally just work on the code side, without having to worry on manually updating the CF templates.

# How it works

- Verify you have .NET Core SDK 2.1.300 (or later) installed.
